/**
 * @fileoverview Base class for Joshfire schema.io datasource collections.
 *
 * This base class wraps a Joshfire Factory datasource in a Backbone
 * collection, ensuring that the "sync" method of the Backbone collection
 * calls the "find" method of the Factory datasource.
 *
 * The class maintains an "hasMore" flag, set when the collection "may" have
 * more items. The flag is set initially and reset when the collection receives
 * fewer items than the number of items requested (the "limit" parameter). This
 * flag could be used by callers e.g. to display/hide a "load more" icon.
 *
 * Note this flag is more a "likely valid" information than an assertion: there
 * may be no more items to fetch when the flag is set, and this mechanism cannot
 * account for collections that receive more items from time to time.
 *
 * The class also maintains a "fetched" flag, set when the collection has been
 * fetched at least one. Note that initializing the collection with a non empty
 * set of item counts as a fetch.
 *
 * The collection triggers a series of events when it is fetched, in order:
 * - "load:start" when fetch starts
 * - "load:first" when first fetch completes, provided it returned at least one
 * item.
 * - "load:more" when a subsequent fetch completes, provided at least one new
 * item got added to the list
 * - "load:last" when fetch completes with no new items or with fewer items
 * than the requested number.
 * - "load" when fetch completes, regardless of whether new items got added to
 * the collection.
 * - "load:error" when an error occurred.
 *
 * Said differently, given a call to "fetch", the collection triggers
 * "load:start". It then triggers one of "load:first" or "load:more" if new
 * items got added to the collection, followed by a "load:last" if no items got
 * added or if fewer items than requested got added. The "load" event completes
 * the series. If an error occurs, the chain of events gets interrupted and a
 * "load:error" event is triggered.
 *
 * The "syncstarted", "syncerror" and "syncsuccess" events are deprecated.
 * They are synonymous to "load:start", "load:error", and "load" for when
 * the collection is fetched. New "update" events should be created when the
 * collection gets updated to support "save" operations.
